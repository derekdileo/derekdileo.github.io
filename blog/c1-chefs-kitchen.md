#### My View on DBC philosophy
#### October 10, 2014


Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

Honestly when I first heard about DBC I can say I had the 'restaurant mindset'. I thought that I could just pay some money to learn a skill. I had applied to multiple coding bootcamps and started to study the basics. When I applied to DBC and watched the first video about 'emotional intelligence' It instantly changed my perspective on what I would be learning. Everything in that video seemed to resonate with me. I believe the reason for this is because I realized in order to be successful in my journey to become a programmer, I need improvement in areas that have nothing to do with coding. Things like meditation and learning how to learn are areas that I could greatly benefit from, and I look forward to learning all the life skills thats DBC will be be teaching.

My expectations of DBC have changed. The focus on building well rounded developers and not just teaching how to code was a big surprise. Before watching the 'emotional intelligence' I was nervous about my ability to deal with the intensity of the program. After watching that video I felt like DBC was the place for me. I feel much less nervous knowing that I will be learning under the DBC philosophy. I am excited to see what the future holds!
