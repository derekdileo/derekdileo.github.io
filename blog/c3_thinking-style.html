                    <h3><p>I have a growth mindset, but this was not always the case. For most of my life I thought that I couldn't achieve the same success as my peers. I didn't did well in school, not because I wasn't smart enough, because I never really was interested. I hated to read and I would avoid any book like the plague. I dropped out of high school without considering the things I would be missing out on. Pretty much, I was the furthest extreme of fixed mindset I believe a person can be. I have a lot of experience with living in a way that neglects growth, and I'm working on changing that. The way I was able change my direction in life was to change my mindset.</p>

<p>The thing that I fear most is usually the most important thing for me to do. The only way it would be possible for me to pick up a book and go back to school would be to change the negative feelings I had associated with learning. Changing the way I felt about learning wasn't easy. The first thing that happened is that I decided I would become a computer programmer (pretty ambitious for someone who didn't finish high school). The fault in my thinking was that I could just jump right into it, that it would be easy. I thought I could just pay some money and quickly learn a skill that would make me a lot of money. Well... I was horribly wrong.</p>

<P>First off, It is not as easy as I thought! Not only was this the most challenging thing I had attempted academically, but I hadn't done myself any favors by not taking school seriously. Furthermore my fault lied in my mindset.</p>

<p>The key to chaining my mindset is focusing on the process rather than the product. If all I saw was the end goal of being a programmer, I would never be patient enough to appreciate the process of becoming one. This is where good programmers are born. People who are genuinely interested in the process, not the product. This makes them to dive deeper into topics, not because they have to, but because they want to. This is the difference between growth and fixed mindset.</p>

<p>Someone with growth mindset will take the time to ask the question 'why?'. They want to know more. They are fascinated with the way things work and play with them for fun. When they make a mistake or get the wrong answer they care to understand why. They are truly excited about the process of learning and don't care so much about the end product.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people with fixed mindset don't care to know more than they have to. They are complacent with the minimum and have no desire to gain more knowledge. They just want the answer to the problem. They don't care how they got it, where it came from, or how it came to be. All they care about is getting to the next step so that they can achieve their goal. Sadly they miss the point.</p>

<p>My biggest challenge at DBC so far has been not rushing through the material. I feel that because I am at a disadvantage academically, I have to go as fast as I possibly can to keep up. I find myself guilty of pursuing the end product and not the process. There is a conflict for me here because it's the end product that I want (to become a developer). This is okay, as long as I take my time through the process. Sometimes I get really excited and find it hard to slow down. As a result I don't learn the material as well as if I would have taken my time.</p>

<p>In order for me to achieve my goal of succeeding at Dev Bootcamp, I must take my time and appreciate the process. Take my time, dig deeper into subjects that are confusing to me, ask 'why?', be curious, read books, and grow!</p></h3>
