                    <h2>What Makes A Good Question?</h2>
                    <h3><p>It can be difficult to ask good questions about coding for many reasons. In order to receive good answers, we have to ask clear and well thought out questions. Good questions are specific and only share the vital information required to replicate the problem. They also should be well punctuated, and proof read to see if the final result makes sense from another perspective.</p><p>Questions that follow these guidelines are more likely to yield faster, more accurate answer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write a title that summarizes the specific problem</li>
                        <li>Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague</li>
                        <li>Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important</li>
                        <li>Introduce the problem before you post any code</li>
                        <li>Keep the explanation simple and concise</li>
                        <li>Help others reproduce the problem</li>
                        <li>Proof-read before posting</li>
                        <li>Respond to feedback</li>
                    </ul>
                    </h3><hr>

                    <h2>What Makes A Bad Question?</h2>
                    <h3>Bad questions are short, not specific, and have too much irrelevant information. Too much irrelevant information can make it difficult to understand . Keeping the question as simple as possible while providing only the necessary information is key. Asking bad questions can result in your question not getting answered, or cause confusion making your question harder for others to respond to. Bad questions are not well though out and are usually things we can answer ourselves.</h3><hr>

                    <h2>My Experience With Coding Questions</h2>
                    <h3>Many times I have gotten stuck on a problem and when I went to ask for help, I answered my own question while trying to explain the problem to someone else. When I take the time to put a well thought out plan together, I often realize what it was that I was confused about. Often I can solve my own problems this way, by formulating well organized questions. If I still don't understand the problem after I have come up with a well thought out question, I can ask my question with confidence and will have a better understanding of the answer I receive. Asking good questions will save a lot of time for everybody.</h3><div class="spacer"></div></div>
