                    <h2>What Is Stereotype Threat?</h2>
                    <h3>The world we live in is full of stereotypes. Everywhere we look there is a stereotype about race, age, sexual orientation, gender, etc. 'Stereotype Threat' is the idea that ones performance can be negatively impacted when confronted with a stereotype that they associate with their identity.</h3>

                    <h2>How Has Stereotype Threat Affected Me?</h2>
                    <h3><p>One stereotype that has affected me, being white, is racial insensitivity. Somehow because I'm white, that means I'm stereotyped to be racially insensitive. My reaction when confronted with this situation is to avoid conversations that involve race. I feel threatened by this stereotype and immediately thoughts about my identity start flooding my head. This is where the 'Stereotype Threat' comes into play.</p><p>I feel that I have to be extra careful when talking about racial issues because I don't want to confirm this stereotype about myself. My focus shifts from having a normal conversation, to worrying that I will offend someone. This shift in focus is where the stereotype threat does it's damage. It will make me second guess myself or feel stressed and uncomfortable. All of these feelings make it difficult to perform any task at a normal level. </p></h3>

                    <h2>How Can We Avoid Stereotype Threat?</h2>
                    <h3><p>I believe there are two parts to diminishing stereotype threat. First I think it would help to not care so much about what other people think. Studies show that the people who care the most also suffer the most from stereotype threat because they have the most to loose. It's not our business what other people think of us, and it's stupid to fill our brains with thoughts about what others may be thinking about us - especially if it's a stereotype. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't listen to feedback and not care what other say. It simply means to not let others define who we are.</p><p>The second thing I think could help get rid of the stereotype threat would be to have more diversity. When people are immersed with others who have different identity traits, they are less judgmental and look for similarities between each other instead of differences. It's easy to feel comfortable when we are in a group that we identify with, however it makes us more susceptible to these threats when we are away from that group. When we are in a diverse environment, previous views or stereotypes we may have had of others tend to disappear and we are left with judgement free relationships.</p></h3><hr>
