                <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

                    <h2>What Is Stereotype Threat?</h2>
                    <h3>The world we live in is full of stereotypes. Everywhere we look there is a stereotype about race, age, sexual orientation, gender, etc. 'Stereotype Threat' is the idea that ones performance can be negatively impacted when confronted with a stereotype that they associate with their identity.</h3>

                    <h2>How Has Stereotype Threat Affected Me?</h2>
                    <h3><p>One stereotype that has affected me is that 'people who drop out of high school are stupid'. This has been an insecurity of mine for many years, and it has made it difficult for my learning process. More specifically I exhibit many traits of the impostor syndrome. I have a hard time accepting anything good about myself. I really don't think that I am good at anything. I believe that I will never be able to succeed, even when I do well at something.</p><p>It all breaks down to confidence, which I have none of when it comes to school. This is because of this stereotype that I keep telling myself 'I must be stupid, because I never finished high school.' Even as I write this I realize how this is not true. Sure I might suck at spelling and my math skills are weak sauce, but I have many other skills and talents which are pretty cool. The stereotypes are never going to go away, but the 'Stereotype Threat' can be diminished if I learn how to deal with this problem.</p>

                    <h2>How Can I Avoid Stereotype Threat?</h2>
                    <p>In order to tackle this issue of mine, I have to remember to not compare myself to others. I will learn what I want to learn if I am patient and willing to put the time in. It may take me longer than some students, but that doesn't mean I am stupid or that I will never be able to understand.</p><p>When I see others struggling in the area of stereotype threat I will do everything I can to make sure they feel comfortable and not to push what is already a sensitive subject. It is important to be able to feel ignorant in a learning environment and not feel judged because of it. This allows for a kind and productive place that can let students perform at the maximum potential.</p>
