                    <h3><p>I recently had a conflict with my sister. Basically, I gave her some parenting advice that was unwelcome and it started an argument between us.</p><p>I had been babysitting for my sisters three kids every Wednesday and developed a system that involved a scheduled bed time routine. This involved taking a shower, brushing teeth, and putting pajamas on. This system seemed to work well for the kids and I thought I would share it with my sister because she always seemed to have a hard time with the kids during bed time.</p><p>When I told my sister about the idea she was very defensive and disagreed with everything that I said. She told me that was not the way she did things. I got a little upset because my system worked so well, and she didn't even want to hear what I had to say. From the start she made it clear that the feedback was unwelcome and I pushed it on here because I thought it would help her. This didn't help the situation, in fact it escalated the conflict. After all, who wants to take advice from their little brother on how to raise their kids?</p><p>I now realize that what I did was not okay. Even though I was nice about about what I was saying, and my delivery was kind, the advice was unwelcome. She didn't want to be told how to handle her kids. Sometimes people don't want advice or feedback and it's not my job to push it on them. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have even brought it up unless I was asked for advice. It's not okay to go through life giving people unwelcome advice and I am guilty of doing this on more than one occasion. I learned that even if I have an idea that I think is good or will help someone, I should only share it when asked for my advice.</p><h3><hr>
