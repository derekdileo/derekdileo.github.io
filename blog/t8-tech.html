                <h2>What Is The Internet?</h2>
                    <h3><p>The internet is a network of networks that share with each other. The internet works by having many computers agree to the same rules or 'protocols'. When two computers are talking to each other you have a network, when another network agrees to play by the same rules, they can share information between all the networks and create a inter-network (internet). In order to understand more about the agreements that all the computers on the internet share you first need to understand a few acronyms:</p>

<p>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) - The IP Address is a unique number that is assigned to EVERY device on the internet.</p>

<p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - The name for the website like google.com</p>

<p>ISP (Internet Service Provider) - The people who provide connections to the internet like Comcast</p>

<p>DNS (Domain Name Server) - Think of a DNS as a glorified phonebook that lets you look up which IP Address are connected to witch URLs</p>

<p>The internet can simple be viewed as a wire that transfers data from one IP address to another. Servers are computers that are directly connected to the internet and web pages are files stored on those severs hard drives. Clients are connect indirectly to the internet using an ISP (internet service provider) When information is sent over the internet the it's broken down into tiny bits and takes many routes to get to it's destination. If one path gets blocked or slowed down, there is another way for the data to get to it's destination. This makes the internet decentralized which means that that there s no single point of failure.</p>

<p>Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect there will be a router. A router is a piece of equipment that directs your packets around the internet to either find the data the client requested, or deliver that data to the client. When you type a URL into the browser, it's likely that the data went through upwards of 10 different routers to get the information back to the client. When the information arrives at it's destination it is reassembled in and then presented to the client. This is a very simple explanation of the internet and how it works, but now you know the basics!</p></h3><hr>
