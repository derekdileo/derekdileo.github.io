                    <h2>What Is Pair Programming?</h2>
                    <h3><p>Pair programming has become a popular way to teach beginners how to program. It's focus is on peers being able to help each other with hands on problems. Two people are each given a roll of 'driver' or 'navigator'. The 'driver' is the one who is control of the keyboard and is responsible for inputing information given by the 'navigator'. The 'navigator's job is to have a more general idea of the direction the program is going. Both 'driver' and 'navigator' help each other when one gets stuck, and this typically limits the amount of mistakes one would make by themselves.</p></h3><hr>

                    <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <h3><p>At first I was a little hesitant about the whole idea of pair programming. I was nervous that I would be slowing down my pair and that I would feel stupid compared to my pair. However this was not my experience. I quickly realized that even if my pair and I are not at the same level of competency, there is still a lot of room to learn on either side. It's nice to be able to share all the 'aha' moments, and give each other feedback.</p><p> Pairing is also nice because it helps avoid going down the wrong path or spending too long on a particular topic. The one thing that I would caution with pair programming is that it's important to stay focused on the problem at hand. When a pair session becomes a chat session, often it can be a distraction from digging in and solving more problems. This has been my biggest frustration with pair programming so far; staying focused and getting the most out of my pairing session.</p>

                    <h2>Feedback Is Vital</h2>
                    <h3><p>After reading feedback that my pairs have given me, I feel a sense of relief. It is nice to know that they enjoy pairing with me as much as I did. It seems that there is a common theme between all my feedback; I am easy to get along with, I have a lot of enthusiasm, and I need to work on time management. I have taken this into consideration and have been addressing this issue by trying to setup a clear idea of what it is that we would like to achieve in our pairing session. I have also made an effort to ask my pair how much time they have work on the problem, and then set some time-boxing to achieve these goals. I feel that the feedback that I am receiving is a little too nice and not very actionable. </p><p>Writing feedback is sometimes a challenge for me. Specifically the anonymous nature of the DBC feedback is something I find not ideal. I prefer to talk to my pair directly and ask for advice or feedback. I also feel that any feedback I would write should be something I would be willing to say to my pairs face, and hiding behind the anonymous feedback feels weird. The most difficult thing that I have faced with pairing is when a pair doesn't take the feedback well and becomes defensive. This is understandable and even helpful because it's teaching me how to interact with people when we don't agree on a topic.</p><p>Overall my experience with pair programming has been positive one. I think it's helpful to be working with people who have the same goal and a similar skill level. This puts everyone on a team and helps push their motivation to the maximum.</p></h3>
