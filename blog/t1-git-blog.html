                <h2>Posted on October 10, 2014</h2>
                <h3>Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp is almost complete! This week we covered CLI (command line interface), Git and Github, and social aspects of the development world.
First we covered the CLI (command line interface). It is a tool programmers use to talk directly to the computer. It allows you to use commands to move around, make changes, edit files, pretty much anything you want. It's unlike any other interface you will find with most computers these days. It doesn't have a GUI (graphical user interface) which means there are no pretty pictures and no mouse clicking, only a text interface. This command line is powerful and vital to developers as it allows you to have full control of what you are doing.

Next we went over version control, specifically Git and Github. Version control is also vital to a programmers workflow because it allows you to have checkpoints that you can revert back to in the event of a problem. It also allows for easy distribution and collaboration on projects. Git is a CLI tool that is used locally on your machine. Github is on the web and allows you to save or 'push' these checkpoints onto the remote repository, enabling easy open source or private project collaboration. Github can be described as the social network of Git.

These tools are standard for any web developer these days and the more comfortable you are with them, the better!
