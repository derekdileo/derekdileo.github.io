                    <h3><p>Achievement is something I highly value in my life. I value achievement because the happiest I have ever been was during my greatest achievements. I also feel that I have not yet achieved what I am capable of achieving. This motivates me to work harder in life, to take bigger risks, and to believe in myself.</p></h3>

                    <h2>Advice?</h2>
                    <h3><p>Motivation and persistence are things I'm sometimes asked for advice about. The first thing I tell people is you can do anything you want. It may take time, but if it's something you are truly passionate about, you will find a way to make it happen. The second thing that comes to mind when giving advice on motivation would be to set a goal. Goals have a way of making life more meaningful because it gives us purpose. How can you make your wishes come true if you never have a wish to begin with? Set a goal and aim for something you think to be difficult but achievable. The only way you can fail is to not try.</p><p>My values will play an important roll while at Dev Bootcamp. I believe persistence is what has got me this far in the first place. Telling myself I CAN do some thing is much more empowering than telling myself I suck at something. There have been many times I have been frustrated while learning to code. It will be important for me to be able to notice my frustration before it happens. This way I can take action before my brain goes into meltdown mode. I'm sure this will be a useful skill to have in life, let alone DBC. I have found that meditating has helped me develop this skill of awareness of myself and feelings. Practice in this area will help me be calm and confident under all circumstances.</p></h3>
