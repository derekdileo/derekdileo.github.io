                    <h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
                    <h3>
                    <p>The general idea behind net neutrality is that all data be treated equally by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and governments. This means that that ISPs shouldn't be allowed to slow down or limit traffic based on the individual user or the type of data the user is trying to access. In other words the idea is that the company that connects us to the internet shouldn't be able to control what we do on the web.</p>
                    </h3>

                    <h2>What's The Problem?</h2>
                    <h3><p>Without net neutrality rules ISPs can do things like throttle speed for services like Netflix that use a lot of bandwidth and subsequently favor or redirect you to other sites which pay more. Large companies like Google can pay ISPs for faster more reliable access to their services than a competing company. This would put smaller companies with less money at a disadvantage, forcing them to use the 'slow road'. This would also allow ISPs to charge more for companies like Netflix that use more bandwidth than others. Ultimately the consumer will pay the price because if Netflix gets charged more to get their data to the consumer, the consumer will have to pay more for Netflix's service.</p><p>On the other hand, IPSs like Comcast and Version argue that all data is not the same because certain types of data like streaming video and voice calls take more bandwidth. They purpose to define net neutrality as equal treatment among similar applications, rather than neutral transmissions regardless of application. The ISPs also argue that regulating the data will help protect against illegal use of file sharing and illicit behavior. There are many more angles to this argument, this is simply the tip of the ice berg.</p></h3>

                    <h2>Is There A Solution?</h2>
                    <h3>This topic is under heavy debate, and any solution will be most likely be some sort of hybrid. It's my belief that in order to resolve this conflict we need to allow for discrimination between different types of data, but not between the companies that are sending the data. This means that things like streaming audio will have priority over other types of data because they need it to work well. This should make most companies happy, and at the same time provide the best service to the consumer with the least amount of restriction.</h3>
