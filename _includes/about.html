                <p class="large text-muted">Coming from a career in entertainment, marketing, and social media, I found myself constantly pulled toward the technical aspects of those fields, leading to the decision to pursue life as a programmer. Working as a full-stack developer has been as fulfilling as I'd always hoped it would be. As a passionate problem-solver, my love of puzzles (<a href="https://youtu.be/-K8XaDLmUxU" target="_blank">particularly Rubik's Cubes</a>), and aptitude for design are maximized through web development.</p>
