                    <p class="large text-muted">With a successful background in entertainment, marketing, and social media, I have found myself pulled towards the technical aspects of these fields. This has inspired me to pursue a career in technology. As a passionate problem-solver, my love of puzzles (<a href="https://youtu.be/-K8XaDLmUxU">particularly Rubik's cubes</a>), interest in programming, and aptitude for design are maximized through web development. I pay close attention to detail, I am enthusiastic, and I have a strong desire to continue advancing my skills. Currently, I am seeking a full-time position in an engaging environment where I can deepen my existing skills, and develop new ones.</p>
