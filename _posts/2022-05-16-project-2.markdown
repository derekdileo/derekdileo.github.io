description: The task assigned for my senior project is to put together a small data collection system and visualize the data in a graphical manner. When brainstorming ideas one evening, my 16-pound cat Juno came in to let me know he was hungry. Now, I cut myself out of that equation *years ago* by getting him an auto-feeder, but he still insists on letting me know when it's dinner time. What happened next was pure serendipity. The instant his feeder began to loudly dispense his food, he bolted out of the room faster than a bat out of hell! It was then that I realized what I had to do....This feat of modern engineering is centered around an Arduino Uno Microcontroller which leverages the power of its ATMega328P to do the unthinkable. The Cat Tracker 5000 uses an AVR PIC sound sensor to detect when your pet's food begins dispensing and stores the foodEvent with a timestamp provided by its fully-programmable DS3231 real-time clock (RTC) module. When your pet arrives on the scene 2.2 seconds later (or faster) to gobble down that hard-earned food, the second sensor-a passive infrared (PIR)-is triggered. The sensor trip triggers an operation which subtracts the foodEvent timestamp from the current timestamp and writes the overall cat response time to an SD card as a CSV. Finally, you can import this data into your favorite spreadsheet program for analysis!
