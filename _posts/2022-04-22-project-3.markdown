description: This was the first time I saw a real world problem that could be solved with software, and was able to develop my own solution back when I was DJing clubs every weekend. The concept is simple, free users (Requesters) can sign in and find nearby premium users (Entertainers) who are 'live on stage' in order to make song requests. Prior to starting a set, Entertainers (DJs, Karaoke Jocks, Cover Bands, etc.) will use the app to enter the venue name and address (or use Location Services) to 'go live on stage' and will be taken to their Requests dashboard and are notified when new requests come in. Entertainers can view, mark as played, and delete requests from their view. The app also has 'go live on air' functionality for radio jocks and streamers which, instead of location services, only requires a web address or radio station call sign where requesters can tune in. The app is built written in Dart on the Flutter framework and uses Google Firebase for email/password authentication and Cloud Firestore for data persistence. Functionally, the MVP app is ready for deployment; however, I need to learn more about in-app purchases and ads before it can be monetized and subsequently released to web, App Store and Google Play. The first iteration, a Rails app which was co-developed with a friend, can be found way back in my GitHub history. Having a web-only application was never the goal, so I took a mobile development course as an elective and was introduced to Dart. I quickly learned, however, that the requirements of this application far exceeded that of the course curriculum. Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to finish this, but plan to in the very near future.  I am currenty in my last semester of college (which is shortened to 12 weeks instead of 16); and, in addition to course load, I am taking an extracurricular full-stack web development course (React, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB) while actively interviewing for jobs after graduation.
