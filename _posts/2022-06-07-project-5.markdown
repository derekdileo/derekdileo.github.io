description:The purpose of this project was to build a RESTful Spring Boot API that would be heavy in CRUD and use JWT for security. I completed the app in 10 days, and it was the first project I built to include Spring Data JPA with Hibernate ORM, and Spring Security. Challenges I overcame included implementing JWT and deploying to Heroku using a PostGreSQL database.
