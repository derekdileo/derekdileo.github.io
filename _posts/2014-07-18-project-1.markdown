description: A space game inspired by MIT's "Spacewar!". Built in Ruby using Gosu. During my internship with Native Cloud Systems, I learned about sprite style 2D games. I wanted to remake the very first computer game, Spacewar!,  and when I found the Ruby Gosu gem, I saw an opportunity to make that happen. This project helped me understand the basics of object oriented programming (while having a blast).
