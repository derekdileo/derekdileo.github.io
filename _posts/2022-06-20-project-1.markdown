description: This Java Spring Boot MVC app aims to tackle the growing problem of youth homelessness and food insecurity in the greater Orlando area. It uses a survey to gather important (and anonymous) data about students and allows city employees to generate reports based on this data. After completing the survey, a customized list of resources is generated and presented to the student based on their responses. Resources can range from soup kitchens to homeless shelters, are rated based on the severity of need, and are uploaded and maintained by city employees within the same web portal as previously mentioned. This project presented a number of challenges, including anonymous data collection and manipulation as well as website and database security; but, the lessons learned were priceless.
