description: This JavaFX GUI program was created to allow a user to enter a website, and start and finish points to determine the frequency of each word within the selected region of text at the URL. The top 10 word occurences (and their frequencies) are then displayed to the JavaFX GUI with the option to view all results in another window. This project helped me understand the basics of Regular Expressions and data persistance using HashMaps (initial method) and MySQL database (final method).
