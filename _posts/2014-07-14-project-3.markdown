description: A voice-controlled kitchen helper app that makes cooking from a recipe a hands-free experience - For my week-long final project at Dev Bootcamp, I worked with three other students to build an app that allows users to search, organize, and prepare recipes with a Siri-like voice interface called Caesar. We decided to use the opportunity to learn some new technologies along the way, so we took a break from Ruby & Rails and built the app on the MEAN (mongoDB, express, angular.js, Node.js) stack instead. Using Ionic, we build iOS and Android versions of the app, as well as the web app.
