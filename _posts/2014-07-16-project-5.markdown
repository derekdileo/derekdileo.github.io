description: After being introduced to IOT devices, I fell in love with them.  I played with an Arduino for bit, then bought a Raspberry Pi. I also had a Parallax Boe-Bot which was fun to use, but limited. I came up with an idea to put all the pieces that I had been playing with together, making the Boe-Bot remote controlled through SSH. I did this by attaching a Raspberry Pi to the bottom of the Boe-Bot. I then connect the Pi to the Arduino, which controlled the Boe-Bot using a program that I wrote in Ruby.
