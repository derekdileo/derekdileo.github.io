description: In the first 9  weeks of Dev Bootcamp our curriculum involved reviewing others' solutions to challenges we were given on Github. This process was time consuming, so I wrote a command line app in Ruby to expedite the process. I then pitched this idea in a hackathon. It was chosen as one of the top projects to be implemented, and I worked with a team of 4 classmates to build a web app version of my command line application over the weekend. This was the first time I saw a real world problem that could be solved with software, and was able to develop my own solution.
